        <li>Pour enough oil into a wok or large skillet to coat the bottom and turn to medium-high heat. 
            Cook and stir onion, shallot, and garlic in hot oil until fragrant and slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Add chicken and bell pepper; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Move chicken mixture to 1 side of wok.</li>
        <li>Place rice noodles in a bowl and fill with hot water,
